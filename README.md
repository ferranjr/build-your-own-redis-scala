# Build Your Own Redis in Scala
Inspired by https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-redis/ 
Using Scala and minimum dependencies (scalaTest and logging)

## Steps
- [X] Step 1. RESP protocol, serializer and deserializer
- [X] Step 2. Run basic commands PING and ECHO
- [X] Step 3. SET and GET, using basic in-memory hash-map in here
- [ ] Step 4. benchmark and non-blocking socker handling (need to benchmark still)
- [ ] Step 5. SET command so that you also accept the EX, PX EAXT PXAT expiry option
- [ ] Step 6. EXISTS, DEL, INCR, DECR, LPUSH, RPUSH, SAVE
- [ ] Step 7. benchmark VS real redis. review performance improvements
- [ ] Step 8. Going further
